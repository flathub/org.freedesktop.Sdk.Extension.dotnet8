# .NET 8 SDK extension

## How to use
You need to add following lines to flatpak manifest:

```json
"sdk-extensions": [
    "org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.dotnet8"
],
"build-options": {
    "append-path": "/usr/lib/sdk/dotnet8/bin",
    "append-ld-library-path": "/usr/lib/sdk/dotnet8/lib",
    "prepend-pkg-config-path": "/usr/lib/sdk/dotnet8/lib/pkgconfig"
},
```

###  Scripts
* `install.sh` - copies dotnet runtime to package.
* `install-sdk.sh` - copies dotnet SDK to package.

### Publishing project

```json
"build-commands": [
    "install.sh",
    "dotnet publish -c Release YourProject.csproj",
    "cp -r --remove-destination /run/build/YourProject/bin/Release/net8.0/publish/ /app/bin/",
]
```

### Using nuget packages
If you want to use nuget packages it is recommended to use the [Flatpak .NET Generator](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder-tools/tree/master/dotnet) tool. It generates sources file that can be included in manifest.

```json
"build-commands": [
    "install.sh",
    "dotnet publish -c Release --source ./nuget-sources --source /usr/lib/sdk/dotnet8/nuget/packages YourProject.csproj",
    "cp -r --remove-destination /run/build/YourProject/bin/Release/net8.0/publish/ /app/bin/"
],
"sources": [
    "sources.json",
    "..."
]
```

### Publishing self contained app and trimmed binaries
.NET 8 gives option to include runtime in published application and trim their binaries. This allows you to significantly reduce the size of the package and get rid of `/usr/lib/sdk/dotnet8/bin/install.sh`. 

Slightly modify the `build-commands` and add the `build-options` as follows:

```json
"build-options": {
    "arch": {
        "aarch64": {
            "env" : {
                "RUNTIME": "linux-arm64"
            }
        },
        "x86_64": {
            "env" : {
                "RUNTIME": "linux-x64"
            }
        }
    }
},
"build-commands": [
    "mkdir -p /app/bin",
    "dotnet publish -c Release --source ./nuget-sources --source /usr/lib/sdk/dotnet8/nuget/packages YourProject.csproj --runtime $RUNTIME --self-contained true",
    "cp -r --remove-destination /run/build/YourProject/bin/Release/net8.0/$RUNTIME/publish/* /app/bin/",
],
```

Note that your nuget packages directory is listed before the one provided with the SDK, the build may fail if ordered differently.
